# XinputReader Record

This is a fork of https://github.com/Erindale/XinputReader

I've made a drone FPV camera with realistic physics to film inside Blender.

I use a Xbox 360 gamepad to control it and XInputReader to get the inputs and use them in Geometry Nodes.

I needed a way to replay the inputs to be able to render. Hence the fork.

I'm only maintaining it for me at the moment, so don't expect any kind of polish.
